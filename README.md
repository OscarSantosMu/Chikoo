## Problematic ðŸš©

During the last 5 years in Mexico there has been a great increase in the demand for the services of clinics adjacent to pharmacies and care in public services, according to data obtained from the National Survey of Health and Nutrition. More than 65% of Mexicans who are affiliated with a public health institution prefer to carry out their medical consultation in this type of office.

This, coupled with the more than 46 million Mexicans who do not have health insurance, has meant that consumption in offices adjacent to pharmacies and public services has grown exponentially, to levels where the simple fact of making a consultation In these types of establishments, can take up to more than 3 hours, since many Mexicans prefer to use these establishments because they are not expensive and are very well located.

And this is a story that more and more Mexicans are living at the national level, if we go to any of these establishments we will find completely full waiting rooms or even lines that extend to the outside of the establishment.


## How can we solve this? âœ‹

When medical consultations are carried out, most of the time is spent in an interrogation to be able to fill out the patient's medical history and to learn more about him. This is so that doctors can generate an efficient consultation based on your medical history.

But **what if we support the doctors to make this interrogation a faster and simpler process so that the efficiency with which the consultations are carried out is greater?** ðŸ¤“


## Meet Chikoo ðŸ’œ

Meet Chikoo (Or Francis in Mazateco), a chatbot that will help you during your journey when filling out your pre-consultation data on your own. Chikoo makes filling in your data as simple as answering a question with an SMS message or making a call to our personal number and filling in your data by voice.

# Installing
### Creating a virtual environment
First, make sure you have the virtualenv package installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can install it using the following command:

```python 
pip install virtualenv
```

Then, create a new virtual environment by running the following command:

```python 
virtualenv env
```

This will create a new directory called env in the current directory, which contains the virtual environment. You can activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

```python 
source env/bin/activate
```

Now you are in the virtual environment and can install the required packages.

### Installing packages using pip
The packages you need can be specified in a requirements.txt file. Each package should be on a separate line. For example, if you need to install the flask and firebase packages, the requirements.txt file should look like this:

```python 
flask
firebase
```

To install the packages, run the following command:

```python 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

### Deactivating the virtual environment
Once you are done working with the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running the following command:

```python 
deactivate
```

This will return you to the original operating system environment.
